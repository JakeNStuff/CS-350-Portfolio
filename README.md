# CS-350-Portfolio
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-The point of the project was to understand how to use the launchpad we were required to get in order to create a working thermostat system that would detect the temperature and use that info to function.
What did you do particularly well?
-I think I did a decent job throughout the course talking with the instructor in order to make sure I had a decent understanding of the project.
Where could you improve?
-My time keeping skills and my general knowledge need to be worked on because I constantly felt like I was using too much time and understanding too little, which culminated in many things not running as intended. 
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
-I need to talk to my peers more regularly and go back to discussions in the past and zybooks in order to better understand the project. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
-My ability to troubleshoot was brought into question during the class and the general apparant dislike I have towards communicating with my peers that I need to fix. This will help me in future classes.
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-I kept the comments and codes as clean as I could in order to keep it readable and adaptable to other situations as there were instances where we had to copy and paste code and I wanted my code to be directly applicable in a plug and play sort of manner.
